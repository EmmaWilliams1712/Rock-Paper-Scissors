This project is a simple implementation of the game rock-paper-scissors built from scratch as my first javascript project. This project will be created using separate files for html, css and javascript but all combined using links in the HTML file. This game includes using javascript functions and statements to get a computer to play as the opponent ensuring the moves are random. It will also keep score of the game contionously until the reset button is clicked, the score, and moves and results of each round will be displayed. HTML and CSS will be used to create the overall layout and styling of the page/game, including some basic HTML elements display the text and buttons on the page.
